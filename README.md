SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to communicate with database systems. It is used in data systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server and many others.

SQL comprises four major sub-languages:

Data Definition Language (DDL): to create and modify the structure of the database;
Data Manipulation Language (DML): to perform Read, Insert, Update and Delete operations on the data of the database;
Data Control Language (DCL): to control the access of the data stored in the database;
Teansaction Control Language (TCL): to control and save data stored in the dataset by admin.
You can read more about SQL via this article on Wikipedia.
